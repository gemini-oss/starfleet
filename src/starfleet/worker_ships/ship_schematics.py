"""Starfleet's worker ship definitions

This defines the base classes and components for all of Starfleet's "worker plugins". The worker plugins are plugins
that are loaded on start-up, and do the actual given task in Starfleet.

All ship plugins *must* implement the components defined here. Documentation for this follows. Also very helpful
to see existing ship plugins to get ideas on how to make your own.
