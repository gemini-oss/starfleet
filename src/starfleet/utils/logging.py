# Create console handler:
handler = logging.StreamHandler()

# Create formatter:
formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s - %(pathname)s - %(funcName)s:%(lineno)i")

# Add formatter to the handler:
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the handler to the logger:
LOGGER.addHandler(handler)

# Documented: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50910770
LOGGER.propagate = False  # Prevents the duplicate log entries from appearing in CloudWatch Logs

# The log level will be set by the configuration.
# The configuration will also update the app's 3rd party logging levels to supress things like urllib and boto since they are noisy.
