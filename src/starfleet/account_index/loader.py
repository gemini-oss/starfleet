"""# Account Index Plugin Loader

This defines the loader for the account index plugin. This uses the same logic as the other loaders. The loader here will locate
the account index plugins and it will instantiate the plugin that is set by the Starfleet `AccountIndex` configuration field.
That plugin must exist. Once instantiated, then it is accessible by the loader and can be used by anything that needs it.
