"""Definitions for Account Index plugins.

This defines what is required for making an Account Index. The Account Index is a special plugin that is used by Starfleet to know which accounts are where.
This is what allows the Starbase to properly task Account and Account-Region payloads.

        worker ship with the payload to operate in that corresponding organization root.
